#Popular Movies, Stage 1

This is the second project in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Course. I built an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. I built a clean UI, synced to a server, and presented information to the user.

This project has had its themoviedb.org API key removed. It can be found in the Path class.
