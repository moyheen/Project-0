# Super Duo!
This is the fourth submitted project for this Nanodegree. I productionized two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. I found and handled error cases, added accessibility features, allowed for localization, added widgets, and added a library.

If there's no data in the app, you'll have to get an API key from http://api.football-data.org/index and insert it into api-key in the strings.xml file.
