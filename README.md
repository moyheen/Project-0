#Popular Movies, Stage 2

The third project in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Course. I added to the app I built in Stage 1 by building on the detail view for each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies, and added a tablet layout.

This project has had its themoviedb.org API key removed. It can be found in the Path class.
